        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>email: <a href="mailto:aleckrsek@gmail.com" target="_blank">aleckrsek@gmail.com</a></p>
        <p>I’m currently a freshman in college at Oregon State University Cascades. I’ve been involved in computer science since middle school and have always been interested in computing and technology. I’ve built several computers and have used Linux for quite a while so I’m very familiar with the Linux ecosystem. </p>

        <p>Working on this portfolio website. And a few other introductory java projects, some of which are using Processing.</p>

        <h2>Relevant Skills</h2>
        <p>I’m working on expanding my Java and Python skills in my current classes I’m enrolled in. I’ve used C++ in the past in 2021 when studying at a community college. I am familiar with diagnosing hardware problems and assembling computing systems.</p>

        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <p>Completed projects I’ve done would be my dotfiles for my old Linux desktop. Not really programming, but really in-depth configuration. <br>I am currently working on this portfolio website, hopefully with some fancy css. </p>
